An individual withdrew $3M USDC from OKX, distributed it across 19 wallets, and opened $20-$30M long positions on POPCAT, creating a fake buy wall at $0.21. When the wall was removed, the price crashed, leading to $63M in total liquidations and a $4.9M loss for Hyperliquid's HLP. This incident, linked to previous manipulations, caused Hyperliquid to temporarily pause its Arbitrum bridge, sparking widespread discussion about market manipulation and the risks of high leverage on decentralized exchanges.
